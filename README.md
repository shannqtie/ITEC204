# ITEC204
A python program that uses keyword and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield.

and – Used in condition checks (ex., combining conditions in if statements).

as – Used for aliasing or in try-except blocks.

assert – For debugging, asserting conditions.

break – Used to exit loops (used in admin_dashboard() and buyer_dashboard()).

class – Used to define classes (User, Product).

continue – Skips current iteration of a loop (could be used in validation or invalid inputs).

def – Defines functions (add_product, view_cart etc.).

del – Deletes objects.

elif – Used in if-elif-else conditions (used in dashboards).

else – Used in if-else conditions (used in dashboards and product actions).

except – Used for exception handling (I’ll add this with try-except).

False – A boolean value (False used in logic).

finally – Executes after try-except.

for – For loops (used in view_products() and view_cart()).

from – For importing modules.

global – Used for global variables (used for current_user).

if – Conditional checks (used for if-else logic).

import – Used for importing modules.

in – Checks if a value is in a list (used for for loops and conditions).

is – Used for identity comparison (e.g., checking None).

lambda – Creates anonymous functions (can be added in the shopping cart for some simple calculations).

None – Used to represent "no value" (used for checking if the cart is empty).

not – Negates conditions (used in checking if the cart is empty).

or – Combines multiple conditions (can be added for more complex checks).

pass – Placeholder for future code. 

raise – Used to raise exceptions (can be added to raise errors when certain conditions are not met).

return – Used in functions to return values (already in place).

True – A boolean value (True is used for conditions).

try – Used for exception handling.

while – Used for loops.

with – Used for managing resources.

yield – Used for generating a sequence lazily.
